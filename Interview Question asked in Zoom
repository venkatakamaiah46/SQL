— Several friends at a cinema ticket office would like to reserve consecutive available seats.
— Can you help to query all the consecutive available seats order by the seat_id using the following cinema table?

— | seat_id | free |
— | — — — — -| — — — |
— | 1 | 1 |
— | 2 | 0 |
— | 3 | 1 |
— | 4 | 1 |
— | 5 | 1 |

— Your query should return the following result for the sample case above.

— | seat_id |
— | — — — — -|
— | 3 |
— | 4 |
— | 5 |

— Note:
— The seat_id is an auto increment int, and free is bool (‘0’ means free, and ‘1’ means occupied.).
— Consecutive available seats are more than 2(inclusive) seats consecutively available.

Answer
=========
WITH consecutive_seats AS (
    SELECT seat_id, free,
           LAG(free) OVER (ORDER BY seat_id) AS prev_free,
           LEAD(free) OVER (ORDER BY seat_id) AS next_free
    FROM cinema
)
SELECT seat_id
FROM consecutive_seats
WHERE free = 1 AND (prev_free = 1 OR next_free = 1)
ORDER BY seat_id;
